   Calculations:
      
       inner core radius:  r = 10 e -3 (m)
       thickness of coil:  w = 2 e -3 (m)
       length of the coil: l = 60 e -3 (m)

       >> calculated L:
   
       u(0) = 1.25664e-06  (4*pi*10-7)
       N = 50

       A = pi*r^2

       L = ( u(0) * N^2 * A )/l = ( (1.25664e-06) * 2500 * pi * (10e-3) * (10e-3) ) / (60e-3)
                                = 1.6449e-05 (H)
                            
       >> simulated L:
   
       d(mm)   L(H)
       50      1.56452e-05
       70      1.57677e-05
       90      1.58148e-05
       110     1.58364e-05
       130     1.58478e-05

   Questions:
   
   - 1) What material do you have to set for the coil to avoid eddy currents in its interior?
   
        ans: air
        
   - 2) Which boundary conditions do you have to set in Nacs at the axis of rotation and along
        the outer boundary? What is/are the corresponding boundary condition(s) for the magnetic
        potential?
        
        ans: to generate a solenoidal magnetic field, the tangential component of the magnetic
             vector potential at the border is set to zero
        
        Boundary Condition in NACS <=> set FluxParallel for all boundaries
        
   - 3) How does the inductance of the setup change if you increase the distance d to the
        boundary? Does the value converge?
        
        ans: if you increase d, the simulated L will increase as well, and it seems to converge 
             to a certain value.
        
   - 4) Compare the simulated inductance with the analytically calculated one and explain the
        differences. Is the model appropriate for further investigations?
        
        ans: The simulated inductance is always smaller than the analytically calculated one,
             because the simulated inductor is inside boundary, and in reality the there is
             no boundary. In general, the difference is not so significant, therefore it is
             a good model.
        
   - 5) Compare the screenshots of the magnetic vector potential for d = 50 mm and d = 150 mm.
        What do you observe, especially at the boundary?
        
        ans: the simulated magnetic line for d=50 seems to be compressed at the boundary,
             which means that the vector potential for d=50 has higher density, which is the
             result from the boundary condition set in NACS

   Questions:
   
   - 1) Compare the Gid screenshots with the iron core at s = 5 mm and s = 30 mm. How does the
        magnetic flux density change?
        
        ans: The flux density has the highest value at the part inside the coil with
             the core inserted, when the iron core moved up, the flux density of the lower part
             of the coil and the upper part of the iron core decreased significantly.

   - 2) Describe the plot showing L in dependency of s and try to formulate the relation s â‡’ L(s).
        You do not have to derive formulas! Just describe some basic properties like slope, type
        of relation (linear, quadratic, ...) etc.
        
        ans: based on the property of the plot, we can see that the slope of the line is negative
             and the line is very smooth. Therefore the relation between s and L(s) is almost
             linear, and with s increasing, the inductance L drops at a linear pace.
