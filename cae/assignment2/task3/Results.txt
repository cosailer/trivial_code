f(2)=201.82 Hz
1st dt= 1/(10*f(2))= 4.9549e-04
requested time for 10 full periods at a frequncy of f(2)=(1/f(2))*10= 4.9549e-02
N=4.9549e-02/4.9549e-04 = 100

2nd dt=1/(15*f(2))= 3.3033e-04
requested time for 10 full periods at a frequncy of f(2)=(1/f(2))*10= 4.9549e-02
N=4.9549e-02/3.3033e-04=150

3rd dt=1/(20*f(2))= 2.4775e-04
requested time for 10 full periods at a frequncy of f(2)=(1/f(2))*10= 4.9549e-02
N=4.9549e-02/2.4775e-04=200

4th dt=1/(25*f(2))= 1.9820e-04
requested time for 10 full periods at a frequncy of f(2)=(1/f(2))*10= 4.9549e-02
N=4.9549e-02/1.9820e-04=250

Questions:

1) Time discretization with 200 steps is fine enough.Because the graph which is showing the result of time discretization with 200 steps is quite the same as for the next 
finer timestep (250 steps).

2) Yes. itâ€™s because that in our case the input frequency and the eigenfrequency of the object are almost the same, also as the Y displacement of top right will exhibit a combination of these two frequencies. so we can see a pure sinusoidal signal.
