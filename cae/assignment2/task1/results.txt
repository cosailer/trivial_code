E = 195e9
J = l*h^3/12
p = 7850

C = sqr(EJ/pA) = sqr( (E*h^2)/(12*p) ) = sqr((195e9*1e-4)/(12*7850)) = 14.388

f = ( r^2 * C ) / (2*pi)

r(1) = 1.875*2 = 3.75
r(2) = 4.694*2 = 9.388
r(3) = 7.855*2 = 15.710

f(1) = 3.75^2 * 14.388 / (2*pi) = 32.202 Hz
f(2) = 9.388^2 * 14.388 / (2*pi) = 201.82 Hz
f(3) = 15.7105^2 * 14.388 / (2*pi) = 565.20 Hz

questions:

1, plane strain, because the width of the part is so big that the plane strain in Z0direction will be equal to 0.
2,It decreases and becomes more closed to calculated ones. The differences in the nodeâ€™s structure, results for quadratic elements are closer to the calculated ones. 

3, the simulated results are larger than the calculated results. here is the list of simulated results:
=======
1, plane strain
2,It dicresease and became more clsoe to calculated ones. They are difference between linear and qaudradic elements,
quadradic elemts lead to more acurate answers 
3, the simulated results are larger than the calculated results
