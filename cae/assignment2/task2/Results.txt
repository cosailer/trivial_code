Questions:

1) By increasing the elements in the x-direction we get closer to the calculated result. Having small number of elements in the x-direction leads to big difference between the harmonic behavior and the calculated result.

2) Using quadratic elements instead of linear elements changes the accuracy of the simulated harmonic behaviour with respect to the calculated result.
